#### If you were me you'd know all of this stuff already!

This web log (blog) does not, in any way, introduce new concepts or programming methods. All credit goes to the innovators of the craft of coding. My blog is simply a curated, best-practice way for my students to have content to study outside of class so we can do programming work inside the classroom. I believe in the active learning model and a moderate 'flipping' of the classroom.

I am a teacher in Michigan. I teach Introduction to Programming Logic, Modern Web Dev, Java, & Unix classes in my community. For a complete rundown on me, see my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/howardebates).
