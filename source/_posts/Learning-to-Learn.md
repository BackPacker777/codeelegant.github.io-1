Before we jump into the actual meat & potatoes, I want to present a small aside on how to learn. [Head First Labs](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/head-first.do) has a really interesting approach to how the brain retains material over at their [Theory/Formula page](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/head-first/formula.do).

Additionally, Coursera has a whole [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) dedicated to this topic that was nicely summed up in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GetMotivated).

After you've investigated the above, we'll jump right into HTML5 & CSS3!
