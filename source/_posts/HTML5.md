I guess I could re-invent the wheel and try to give a complete tutorial on HTML5 but that would be just dumb. There are literally dozens of excellent resources out there to learn from. In the list below, I will order them for you. Follow the order and you will be rockin'! Total time investment? I'd say about **80** hours of  reading, watching, & coding. Good luck! p.s. Please remember to use the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) as a reference

##### Final thoughts

As you complete the projects, it would be good to begin to get a peek at the entirety of the front-end development world. A lot of really great resources and insights are found in the [**_Front-End Developer Handbook_**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook-2017/details). Additionally, a few visits to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/) & [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/) each week will keep you in the loop.
