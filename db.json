I had all kinds of trouble setting it up with a vanilla Windows 10 computer. [HERE](https://malekbenz.com/blog/2016/09/10/Create-Host-Blog-for-free-with-Hexo-Github) is a good tutorial but with some caveats (see below). Hexo works because you have already installed Node.js on your computer.\n![Hexo](/stuff/hexo.png)\n\n#### Hexo Caveats\n\nI had to update my _config.yml file with the following:\n* I downloaded a new theme from Hexo's [theme site](https://hexo.io/themes/), put it in the themes directory and set the **theme:** to its name.\n* I changed the public path to:  ```./``` so that my blog would be available from the root url.\n* I had trouble getting the server to run, so I ran the ```hexo generate``` command first then the ```hexo server -s``` command.\n* **EVERYTHING** is case-sensitive. Beware.\n\nThis should get you up & running! These tasks should be fairly complex if you are new to all of this, but it is a good introduction to workflow for this vocation.

I will link to specific chapters for various topics below.\n\nI teach an Introduction to Programming Logic class for a community college as well as for a semester at our high school. I use JavaScript for _this_ class only insofar as to allow the students to test their algorithms and understand the coding process. I don't teach any language features other than what are strictly needed to perform the coding projects, for example the library ```readline-sync``` so they can read input from the command line. This is the order I use for my students, over a 16-week period:\n\n* Code layout - Simply how to format each program file they will turn in for grading. I teach four sections: 1. Comment header, pragmas, & library imports; 2. Global variable declarations & constant declarations/initializations; 3. dispatching section using a main function; 4. All methods - Mutators & workers. Every project my students turn in follow that code layout pattern.\n* Syntax and style - How we will format the code and what the language reserved words are.\n* Comments - Single-line, multi-line, and JSDoc.\n* Variables, constants, & scope - Data type, declaring, & initializing.\n* Operators - <, >, ===, !==, <=, >=, arithmetic: ** + - \\* / % \\*\\* **\n* Synchronous functions - How to modularize their code into smaller, cohesive chunks.

(I personally loathe jQuery, so I can’t recommend those parts at the end.)</li>\n<li>Regular expressions - For your library, I would recommend these two books: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124\"><em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em></a> + <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do\">Errata</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Regular-Expressions-Cookbook-Solutions-Programming/dp/1449319432\"><em>Regular Expressions Cookbook</em></a> + <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023630.do\">Errata</a>. <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/you-dont-know-anything-about-regular-expressions-a-complete-guide--net-7869\">THIS</a> is a great tutorial, <a href=\"https://regex101.com/\">THIS</a> is a great regex tester, &amp; <a href=\"https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/\">THIS</a> is a great cheat sheet.</li>\n<li>File I/O <a href=\"/stuff/fileIO.txt\">demo code</a>.

In fact all it did was respond to a client request with a simple string of text. When you think about it, that's still pretty neat because the client could have been anywhere in the world and transacted with the web server: The one **YOU** wrote, with your hand fingers!  \nAs awesome as that is, we _probably_ want a little more functionality. In this lesson, we'll add some routes. That means when a client requests a specific resource from our server like a page a photos of our dog, we can respond with the correct data. We'll also add the ability to handle mime types whereby, if the client requests a non-plain text item like a photo, we can tell the browser how to display it to the user. If we didn't, the browser would display EVERYONES favorite picture:  \n![](/stuff/noimage.png)  \nRight now, your web server code should look like this:  \n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n     constructor() {\n          this.loadServer();\n     }\n\n     loadServer() {\n          const HTTP = require('http');\n          const PORT = 8000;\n\n          HTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n               response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n               response.write(`Look at my website!`);\n               response.end();\n          }).listen(PORT);\n     }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nTo make our web presence all fancy, we'll use some CSS to style it and some pictures to snazz it up. Let's tell our server to ask questions about the client request:\n  \n```javascript\n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.html') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nNotice that the guts of the loadServer() function's logic has changed. Some folks prefer to use a **[switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)** statement instead of cascading if statements. Whatever floats your boat. I like my way. The magic of what's happening here are the **request.url.indexOf** statements. If we have a look-see at the 'ol JavaScript API for [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf) we see that this technique is a way to search a text string for the occurrence of what we're looking for. In the case of the first **if** test, we're looking for the character sequence **.css** in the request **url**. Hmmmm, any idea what files may have the extension .css? Yes! Our css stylesheets! We have to put some commands inside the if blocks to handle the request once we've decided what it is. I like this technique:  \n```javascript  \n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\t\t\n\t\t\tlet httpHandler = (error, string, contentType) => {\n\t\t\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\t\t\t response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n\t\t\t\t\t response.end('An error has occurred: ' + error.message);\n\t\t\t\t} else if (contentType.indexOf('css') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('html') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('js') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'binary');\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.html') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nThe first step is to create a **function expression** that accepts an error, the string content from the render function (we haven't made this yet), and the content type of the request from the client. Hold up. You're probably wondering how we are going to send our _images_ as string. Great question! First, see [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1892044/466246) on why we don't use binary. Here is what your pictures look like before we tell the browser to translate them to binary:  \n![Pic of Grandma!](/stuff/stringbinary.png)\nAwww, grandma...!  \n\nThis is the reason we have to handle (encode) the mime types and tell the browser to render the response from our web server as either **binary** for all non-plain text data, and **utf-8** for all plain text data. What's **utf-8**? see [THIS](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33358306/466246).  \nOk, now let's add the ability to read the data off of the hard drive of your server so you can give it to the client.  \n```javascript  \n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\t\t\n\t\t\tlet httpHandler = (error, string, contentType) => {\n\t\t\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\t\t\t response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n\t\t\t\t\t response.end('An error has occurred: ' + error.message);\n\t\t\t\t} else if (contentType.indexOf('css') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('html') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('js') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'binary');\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.html') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t\t\n\t\trender(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n\t\t\tconst FS = require('fs');\n\t\t\tFS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : 'utf-8', (error, string) => {\n\t\t\t\tcallback(error, string, contentType);\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nYou'll note that there is an instance method at the bottom of our code that's responsible for actually _reading_ the data off of the server hard drive by using the Node.js **[fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)** library and, specifically, its **[readFile()](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback)** method. The render function takes in a pad-ton of parameters: The path on our hard drive of the client request, the mime content type requested, a callback function (it will the the **httpHandler** function expression), and the encoding (**binary**, or **utf-8**) we'll tell the client browser. The **readFile()** function's parameters are a little more complicated. The first parameter is the path from above, then the next parameter is a **[ternary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)** that says \"if no encoding is passed to me, use **utf-8** as my default\", and finally, we use an anonymous arrow callback function per the **fs.readFile()** spec. The callback allows the server to read the files from the hard drive asynchronously and give the results to our callback (**httpHandler**) that was passed in as a parameter to the render function.  \nNow we're ready to finally fill in those if blocks with some action!  \n```javascript  \n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\n               let httpHandler = (error, string, contentType) => {\n                    if (error) {\n                         response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n                         response.end('An error has occurred: ' + error.message);\n                    } else if (contentType.indexOf('css') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('html') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('js') >= 0) {\n                         response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n                         response.end(string, 'utf-8');\n                    } else {\n                         response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n                         response.end(string, 'binary');\n                    }\n               };\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'text/css', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'application/javascript', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('/') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render('public/views/index.html', 'text/html', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'image/png', httpHandler, 'binary');\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(`HEY! What you're looking for: It's not here!`, 'text/html', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t}\n\n    render(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n        const FS = require('fs');\n        FS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : 'utf-8', (error, string) => {\n            callback(error, string, contentType);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n``` \nAlrighty then! This code simply calls the **render()** method and uses the JavaScript **[String.slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)** function to send the path & filename requested from the client browser (index.html, etc.) as the first parameter, then it passes **render()** the mime content type, the callback function (httpHandler, finally!), and the encoding we need to used based on the file requested. That's it! You now have a fully operational battle station, er, web server! (Sorry, my inner Star Wars was coming through there).  \nWe still have one more step to do before we can respond to requests. You have NO content on the hard drive to serve up! Please create a **css**, **html**, & **js** file and put them in your web server app root directory. NOW you can fire it up and test it out!\nIf it works:\n![Great Job!](/stuff/awesome.jpg)\n\nIf it does NOT work:\n![You're trying hard!](/stuff/betterjob.jpg)\n\nHeh, just kidding! Try hard to figure out what is broken. Remember to use **console.log()** to diagnose problems. Utilize the Chrome developer tools, and the Node.js output in the terminal window. \n\nExercise, yay!\n>Add support for jpeg images and a web page called about.html.\n\nTime for a philosophical discussion. By now you've heard of the terms _[express.js](https://expressjs.com/)_, or _[koa.js](http://koajs.com/)_, or other Frameworks. I'm sure there is a ratio of 1 billion:1 of people in favor of frameworks vs. coding it out in Node.js by hand. I'm not one of them. Look, I get that there are libraries out there to abstract away all of the hard stuff, but I'd rather get really good at the hard stuff. For example, I am on the Ski Patrol, and we have patrollers that swear by the latest and greatest skis, poles, boots, gloves, helmets, etc. But we also have patrollers that can ski in the glades on a pair of 2x4s duct-taped to their feet and look good doing it. They can do this because they are _Masters_ of skiing, not the equipment. Please consider coding for the enjoyment of it and to move from apprentice to master. By all means, as you do A LOT more of this, start to add libraries like **[url](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html)** & **[httpdispatcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpdispatcher)** to make your life easier, but I encourage you to master vanilla Node.js first.  \n\nWell, that's it for now. In the [next & and final installment](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/20/Vanilla-Node-js-Web-Server-3/), we'll cover the [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) templating engine, and data handling with databases ([NeDB](http://stackabuse.com/nedb-a-lightweight-javascript-database/)) & csv files.","source":"_posts/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Vanilla Node.js Web Server - 2\ndate: 2017-03-17 05:52:12\ntags: node.js, web server, es6, http, mime\ncategories: Crafting vanilla Node.js web server\n---\n\nIn the [1st lesson](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/16/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver/), we made a very basic web server.

What's **utf-8**? see [THIS](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33358306/466246).  \nOk, now let's add the ability to read the data off of the hard drive of your server so you can give it to the client.  \n```javascript  \n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\t\t\n\t\t\tlet httpHandler = (error, string, contentType) => {\n\t\t\t\tif (error) {\n\t\t\t\t\t response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n\t\t\t\t\t response.end('An error has occurred: ' + error.message);\n\t\t\t\t} else if (contentType.indexOf('css') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('html') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('js') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n\t\t\t\t\tresponse.end(string, 'binary');\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.html') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\n\t\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t\t\n\t\trender(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n\t\t\tconst FS = require('fs');\n\t\t\tFS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : 'utf-8', (error, string) => {\n\t\t\t\tcallback(error, string, contentType);\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nYou'll note that there is an instance method at the bottom of our code that's responsible for actually _reading_ the data off of the server hard drive by using the Node.js **[fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)** library and, specifically, its **[readFile()](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback)** method. The render function takes in a pad-ton of parameters: The path on our hard drive of the client request, the mime content type requested, a callback function (it will the the **httpHandler** function expression), and the encoding (**binary**, or **utf-8**) we'll tell the client browser. The **readFile()** function's parameters are a little more complicated. The first parameter is the path from above, then the next parameter is a **[ternary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)** that says \"if no encoding is passed to me, use **utf-8** as my default\", and finally, we use an anonymous arrow callback function per the **fs.readFile()** spec. The callback allows the server to read the files from the hard drive asynchronously and give the results to our callback (**httpHandler**) that was passed in as a parameter to the render function.  \nNow we're ready to finally fill in those if blocks with some action!  \n```javascript  \n// todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.loadServer();\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t\tconst HTTP = require('http');\n\t\tconst PORT = 8000;\n\t\t\n\t\tHTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n\n               let httpHandler = (error, string, contentType) => {\n                    if (error) {\n                         response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n                         response.end('An error has occurred: ' + error.message);\n                    } else if (contentType.indexOf('css') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('html') >= 0 || contentType.indexOf('js') >= 0) {\n                         response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n                         response.end(string, 'utf-8');\n                    } else {\n                         response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': contentType});\n                         response.end(string, 'binary');\n                    }\n               };\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif (request.url.indexOf('.css') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'text/css', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.js') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'application/javascript', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('/') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render('public/views/index.html', 'text/html', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t} else if (request.url.indexOf('.png') >= 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(request.url.slice(1), 'image/png', httpHandler, 'binary');\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tthis.render(`HEY! What you're looking for: It's not here!`, 'text/html', httpHandler, 'utf-8');\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}).listen(PORT);\n\t}\n\n    render(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n        const FS = require('fs');\n        FS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : 'utf-8', (error, string) => {\n            callback(error, string, contentType);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n``` \nAlrighty then! This code simply calls the **render()** method and uses the JavaScript **[String.slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)** function to send the path & filename requested from the client browser (index.html, etc.) as the first parameter, then it passes **render()** the mime content type, the callback function (httpHandler, finally!), and the encoding we need to used based on the file requested. That's it! You now have a fully operational battle station, er, web server! (Sorry, my inner Star Wars was coming through there).  \nWe still have one more step to do before we can respond to requests. You have NO content on the hard drive to serve up! Please create a **css**, **html**, & **js** file and put them in your web server app root directory. NOW you can fire it up and test it out!\nIf it works:\n![Great Job!](/stuff/awesome.jpg)\n\nIf it does NOT work:\n![You're trying hard!](/stuff/betterjob.jpg)\n\nHeh, just kidding! Try hard to figure out what is broken. Remember to use **console.log()** to diagnose problems. Utilize the Chrome developer tools, and the Node.js output in the terminal window. \n\nExercise, yay!\n>Add support for jpeg images and a web page called about.html.\n\nTime for a philosophical discussion. By now you've heard of the terms _[express.js](https://expressjs.com/)_, or _[koa.js](http://koajs.com/)_, or other Frameworks. I'm sure there is a ratio of 1 billion:1 of people in favor of frameworks vs. coding it out in Node.js by hand. I'm not one of them. Look, I get that there are libraries out there to abstract away all of the hard stuff, but I'd rather get really good at the hard stuff. For example, I am on the Ski Patrol, and we have patrollers that swear by the latest and greatest skis, poles, boots, gloves, helmets, etc. But we also have patrollers that can ski in the glades on a pair of 2x4s duct-taped to their feet and look good doing it. They can do this because they are _Masters_ of skiing, not the equipment. Please consider coding for the enjoyment of it and to move from apprentice to master. By all means, as you do A LOT more of this, start to add libraries like **[url](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html)** & **[httpdispatcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpdispatcher)** to make your life easier, but I encourage you to master vanilla Node.js first.  \n\nWell, that's it for now. In the [next & and final installment](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/20/Vanilla-Node-js-Web-Server-3/), we'll cover the [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) templating engine, and data handling with databases ([NeDB](http://stackabuse.com/nedb-a-lightweight-javascript-database/)) & csv files.","slug":"Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-20T12:52:08.334Z","_id":"cj0i03ou70008y8acg3j13ut4","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>In the <a href=\"https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/16/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver/\">1st lesson</a>, we made a very basic web server. In fact all it did was respond to a client request with a simple string of text. When you think about it, that’s still pretty neat because the client could have been anywhere in the world and transacted with the web server: The one <strong>YOU</strong> wrote, with your hand fingers!<br>As awesome as that is, we <em>probably</em> want a little more functionality. In this lesson, we’ll add some routes. That means when a client requests a specific resource from our server like a page a photos of our dog, we can respond with the correct data. We’ll also add the ability to handle mime types whereby, if the client requests a non-plain text item like a photo, we can tell the browser how to display it to the user. If we didn’t, the browser would display EVERYONES favorite picture:<br><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/stuff/noimage.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><br>Right now, your web server code should look like this:<br><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">//  todo:</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\"></span></div><div class=\"line\">\"use strict\";</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">     <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();</div><div class=\"line\">     &#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">     loadServer() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">          HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">               response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, &#123;<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\">               response.write(<span class=\"string\">`Look at my website!`</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">               response.end();</div><div class=\"line\">          &#125;).listen(PORT);</div><div class=\"line\">     &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>To make our web presence all fancy, we’ll use some CSS to style it and some pictures to snazz it up.

Some folks prefer to use a <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">switch</a></strong> statement instead of cascading if statements. Whatever floats your boat. I like my way. The magic of what’s happening here are the <strong>request.url.indexOf</strong> statements. If we have a look-see at the ‘ol JavaScript API for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">indexOf</a> we see that this technique is a way to search a text string for the occurrence of what we’re looking for. In the case of the first <strong>if</strong> test, we’re looking for the character sequence <strong>.css</strong> in the request <strong>url</strong>. Hmmmm, any idea what files may have the extension .css? Yes! Our css stylesheets! We have to put some commands inside the if blocks to handle the request once we’ve decided what it is. I like this technique:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">// todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n    }\n\n    loadServer() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n        HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">let</span> httpHandler = <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">error, string, contentType</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (error) {\n                     response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">500</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n                     response.end(<span class=\"string\">'An error has occurred: '</span> + error.message);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n                }\n            };\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.png'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n\n            }\n\n        }).listen(PORT);\n    }\n}\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first step is to create a <strong>function expression</strong> that accepts an error, the string content from the render function (we haven’t made this yet), and the content type of the request from the client. Hold up. You’re probably wondering how we are going to send our <em>images</em> as string. Great question! First, see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1892044/466246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this answer</a> on why we don’t use binary.

What’s <strong>utf-8</strong>? see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/33358306/466246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">THIS</a>.<br>Ok, now let’s add the ability to read the data off of the hard drive of your server so you can give it to the client.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">// todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n    }\n\n    loadServer() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n        HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">let</span> httpHandler = <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">error, string, contentType</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (error) {\n                     response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">500</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n                     response.end(<span class=\"string\">'An error has occurred: '</span> + error.message);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n                }\n            };\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.png'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n\n            }\n\n        }).listen(PORT);\n\n        render(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n            <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> FS = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'fs'</span>);\n            FS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>, (error, string) =&gt; {\n                callback(error, string, contentType);\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll note that there is an instance method at the bottom of our code that’s responsible for actually <em>reading</em> the data off of the server hard drive by using the Node.js <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">fs</a></strong> library and, specifically, its <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">readFile()</a></strong> method. The render function takes in a pad-ton of parameters: The path on our hard drive of the client request, the mime content type requested, a callback function (it will the the <strong>httpHandler</strong> function expression), and the encoding (<strong>binary</strong>, or <strong>utf-8</strong>) we’ll tell the client browser. The <strong>readFile()</strong> function’s parameters are a little more complicated. The first parameter is the path from above, then the next parameter is a <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ternary</a></strong> that says “if no encoding is passed to me, use <strong>utf-8</strong> as my default”, and finally, we use an anonymous arrow callback function per the <strong>fs.readFile()</strong> spec. The callback allows the server to read the files from the hard drive asynchronously and give the results to our callback (<strong>httpHandler</strong>) that was passed in as a parameter to the render function.<br>Now we’re ready to finally fill in those if blocks with some action!  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">// todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n    }\n\n    loadServer() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n        HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n\n               <span class=\"keyword\">let</span> httpHandler = <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">error, string, contentType</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n                    <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (error) {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">500</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n                         response.end(<span class=\"string\">'An error has occurred: '</span> + error.message);\n                    } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                         response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n                    } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                         response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n                    }\n               };\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'text/css'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'application/javascript'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(<span class=\"string\">'public/views/index.html'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'text/html'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.png'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'image/png'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(<span class=\"string\">`HEY!

This code simply calls the <strong>render()</strong> method and uses the JavaScript <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">String.slice()</a></strong> function to send the path &amp; filename requested from the client browser (index.html, etc.) as the first parameter, then it passes <strong>render()</strong> the mime content type, the callback function (httpHandler, finally!), and the encoding we need to used based on the file requested. That’s it! You now have a fully operational battle station, er, web server! (Sorry, my inner Star Wars was coming through there).<br>We still have one more step to do before we can respond to requests. You have NO content on the hard drive to serve up! Please create a <strong>css</strong>, <strong>html</strong>, &amp; <strong>js</strong> file and put them in your web server app root directory.

Try hard to figure out what is broken. Remember to use <strong>console.log()</strong> to diagnose problems. Utilize the Chrome developer tools, and the Node.js output in the terminal window. </p>\n<p>Exercise, yay!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Add support for jpeg images and a web page called about.html.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Time for a philosophical discussion. By now you’ve heard of the terms <em><a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">express.js</a></em>, or <em><a href=\"http://koajs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">koa.js</a></em>, or other Frameworks. I’m sure there is a ratio of 1 billion:1 of people in favor of frameworks vs. coding it out in Node.js by hand. I’m not one of them. Look, I get that there are libraries out there to abstract away all of the hard stuff, but I’d rather get really good at the hard stuff. For example, I am on the Ski Patrol, and we have patrollers that swear by the latest and greatest skis, poles, boots, gloves, helmets, etc. But we also have patrollers that can ski in the glades on a pair of 2x4s duct-taped to their feet and look good doing it. They can do this because they are <em>Masters</em> of skiing, not the equipment. Please consider coding for the enjoyment of it and to move from apprentice to master. By all means, as you do A LOT more of this, start to add libraries like <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">url</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpdispatcher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">httpdispatcher</a></strong> to make your life easier, but I encourage you to master vanilla Node.js first.  </p>\n<p>Well, that’s it for now. In the <a href=\"https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/20/Vanilla-Node-js-Web-Server-3/\">next &amp; and final installment</a>, we’ll cover the <a href=\"http://www.embeddedjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">EJS</a> templating engine, and data handling with databases (<a href=\"http://stackabuse.com/nedb-a-lightweight-javascript-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">NeDB</a>) &amp; csv files.</p>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<p>In the <a href=\"https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/16/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver/\">1st lesson</a>, we made a very basic web server. In fact all it did was respond to a client request with a simple string of text. When you think about it, that’s still pretty neat because the client could have been anywhere in the world and transacted with the web server: The one <strong>YOU</strong> wrote, with your hand fingers!<br>As awesome as that is, we <em>probably</em> want a little more functionality. In this lesson, we’ll add some routes. That means when a client requests a specific resource from our server like a page a photos of our dog, we can respond with the correct data. We’ll also add the ability to handle mime types whereby, if the client requests a non-plain text item like a photo, we can tell the browser how to display it to the user. If we didn’t, the browser would display EVERYONES favorite picture:<br><img src=\"/stuff/noimage.png\" alt=\"\"><br>Right now, your web server code should look like this:<br><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">//  todo:</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\"></div><div class=\"line\">\"use strict\"</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">     <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();</div><div class=\"line\">     &#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">     loadServer() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">          HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">               response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, &#123;<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\">               response.write(<span class=\"string\">`Look at my website!`</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">               response.end();</div><div class=\"line\">          &#125;).listen(PORT);</div><div class=\"line\">     &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>To make our web presence all fancy, we’ll use some CSS to style it and some pictures to snazz it up.

Some folks prefer to use a <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch\">switch</a></strong> statement instead of cascading if statements. Whatever floats your boat. I like my way. The magic of what’s happening here are the <strong>request.url.indexOf</strong> statements. If we have a look-see at the ‘ol JavaScript API for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf\">indexOf</a> we see that this technique is a way to search a text string for the occurrence of what we’re looking for. In the case of the first <strong>if</strong> test, we’re looking for the character sequence <strong>.css</strong> in the request <strong>url</strong>. Hmmmm, any idea what files may have the extension .css? Yes! Our css stylesheets! We have to put some commands inside the if blocks to handle the request once we’ve decided what it is.

Hold up. You’re probably wondering how we are going to send our <em>images</em> as string. Great question! First, see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1892044/466246\">this answer</a> on why we don’t use binary. Here is what your pictures look like before we tell the browser to translate them to binary:<br><img src=\"/stuff/stringbinary.png\" alt=\"Pic of Grandma!\"><br>Awww, grandma…!  </p>\n<p>This is the reason we have to handle (encode) the mime types and tell the browser to render the response from our web server as either <strong>binary</strong> for all non-plain text data, and <strong>utf-8</strong> for all plain text data. What’s <strong>utf-8</strong>? see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/33358306/466246\">THIS</a>.<br>Ok, now let’s add the ability to read the data off of the hard drive of your server so you can give it to the client.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">// todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n    }\n\n    loadServer() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n        HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">let</span> httpHandler = <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">error, string, contentType</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (error) {\n                     response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">500</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n                     response.end(<span class=\"string\">'An error has occurred: '</span> + error.message);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n                } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                    response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                    response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n                }\n            };\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.png'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n\n            }\n\n        }).listen(PORT);\n\n        render(path, contentType, callback, encoding) {\n            <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> FS = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'fs'</span>);\n            FS.readFile(path, encoding ? encoding : <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>, (error, string) =&gt; {\n                callback(error, string, contentType);\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll note that there is an instance method at the bottom of our code that’s responsible for actually <em>reading</em> the data off of the server hard drive by using the Node.js <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html\">fs</a></strong> library and, specifically, its <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback\">readFile()</a></strong> method. The render function takes in a pad-ton of parameters: The path on our hard drive of the client request, the mime content type requested, a callback function (it will the the <strong>httpHandler</strong> function expression), and the encoding (<strong>binary</strong>, or <strong>utf-8</strong>) we’ll tell the client browser. The <strong>readFile()</strong> function’s parameters are a little more complicated. The first parameter is the path from above, then the next parameter is a <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\">ternary</a></strong> that says “if no encoding is passed to me, use <strong>utf-8</strong> as my default”, and finally, we use an anonymous arrow callback function per the <strong>fs.readFile()</strong> spec. The callback allows the server to read the files from the hard drive asynchronously and give the results to our callback (<strong>httpHandler</strong>) that was passed in as a parameter to the render function.<br>Now we’re ready to finally fill in those if blocks with some action!  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">// todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n    }\n\n    loadServer() {\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n        HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n\n               <span class=\"keyword\">let</span> httpHandler = <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">error, string, contentType</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n                    <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (error) {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">500</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n                         response.end(<span class=\"string\">'An error has occurred: '</span> + error.message);\n                    } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'html'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span> || contentType.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                         response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n                    } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                         response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: contentType});\n                         response.end(string, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n                    }\n               };\n\n            <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.css'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'text/css'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'application/javascript'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(<span class=\"string\">'public/views/index.html'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'text/html'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'utf-8'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (request.url.indexOf(<span class=\"string\">'.png'</span>) &gt;= <span class=\"number\">0</span>) {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(request.url.slice(<span class=\"number\">1</span>), <span class=\"string\">'image/png'</span>, httpHandler, <span class=\"string\">'binary'</span>);\n            } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n                <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.render(<span class=\"string\">`HEY!

That’s it! You now have a fully operational battle station, er, web server!

By now you’ve heard of the terms <em><a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">express.js</a></em>, or <em><a href=\"http://koajs.com/\">koa.js</a></em>, or other Frameworks. I’m sure there is a ratio of 1 billion:1 of people in favor of frameworks vs. coding it out in Node.js by hand. I’m not one of them. Look, I get that there are libraries out there to abstract away all of the hard stuff, but I’d rather get really good at the hard stuff. For example, I am on the Ski Patrol, and we have patrollers that swear by the latest and greatest skis, poles, boots, gloves, helmets, etc. But we also have patrollers that can ski in the glades on a pair of 2x4s duct-taped to their feet and look good doing it. They can do this because they are <em>Masters</em> of skiing, not the equipment. Please consider coding for the enjoyment of it and to move from apprentice to master. By all means, as you do A LOT more of this, start to add libraries like <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html\">url</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpdispatcher\">httpdispatcher</a></strong> to make your life easier, but I encourage you to master vanilla Node.js first.  </p>\n<p>Well, that’s it for now.

You will also need to have downloaded & installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Also, you probably need a 'pew pew' break about now, so please go get some frag time logged and come back when you have all the wiggles out.  \n  \n#### Starting our 1st project\nPlease create a new, blank project in IntelliJ. It should look like this:  \n![Screenshot 1](/stuff/capture1.png)  \nNow we want to enter the following command to generate our **package.json** project file: **npm init** and answer all of the questions. BOOM! you are well on you way! Wait, what the heck is this file for anyway? Glad you asked, [THIS](http://browsenpm.org/package.json) interactive guide will walk you through all of the parts.  \n\nNext create a new JavaScript file in the root directory of your project and name it **app.js**. Inside the file, create a single-line comment on the top thusly:  **//todo:**  \nSince I like the new ES6 classes/objects structure, I'm gonna make you do it too. Create your class structure with the constructor and include the \"use strict\"; pragma and the module export on the bottom of your file. It should look like this:  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nFrom here, we have a decision to make. We can code our web server logic from scratch (LOTS of coding for something that already exists for free), or we can use the FREE library called **http**. Hmmmm, I think we'll use the already completed code in the library! Wanna know why? View the source code [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/lib)(start at http and follow the trail....).  \nSo, to add the library import for **http**, make your code look like this:  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t    const HTTP = require('http');\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nNotice that I created an instance method called loadServer and declared/initialized a constant inside of it that is assigned to our library call. Since **http** is part of the standard Node.js library, I don't have to include it as a dependency in my **package.json** file. **_DO YOU UNDERSTAND??_** If not, take a minute, a figure out what you don't understand. Use the Googles, or StackOverflow....  \n  \nOk, we're getting there. Let's add some actual functionality. If we look at the **[http api](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)**, we can see the various methods we need to employ to get this dang thing to do stuff. The most important thing we want it to do is respond to web browser requests (well, actually, I'd also prefer it to not error-out when I try to start it up!). Add the following code which tells the server which port to listen for browser requests on & runs the **[createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener)** method of **http**.  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n     constructor() {\n          this.loadServer();\n     }\n\n     loadServer() {\n          const HTTP = require('http');\n          const PORT = 8000;\n\n          HTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n               response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n               response.write(`Look at my website!`);\n               response.end();\n          }).listen(PORT);\n     }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nWhoa, whoa, whoa..... What's all that response shenanigans? Well...., if you remember back to the earlier articles I asked you to read a few paragraphs up, you know that is how your little server responds back to the client web browser. **[response.writeHead](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers)** writes the header stuff, **[response.write](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_write_chunk_encoding_callback)** sends chunks of data back to the client browser. (In this case, just a simple string). **[response.end](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding_callback)** 'hangs up the phone.'\nCool, cool. But what does that **.listen(PORT)** thingy do? It is the [method](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback) that **http** actually uses to listen for incoming requests from your buddies trying to check out your new web coding skills!  \n\nTime to test this baby out. Since it is a class file, we need a way to instantiate an object from it. This is a three (3) step process:  \n1. Edit your **package.json** created earlier to change the scripts section from:  \n```javascript\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n```  \nto:  \n```javascript\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node bin/server\"\n  },\n```  \n\n2. Create a directory called **bin** in the root of our project.\n\n3. Create a file called **server** in the bin directory that has the following IIFE:  \n```javascript\n(() => {\n    const APP = require('../app.js');\n    new APP();\n})();\n```  \nRemember that **module.exports = app;** part at the bottom of your **app.js** file? This is how the **server** file can import it like a library and allow us to instantiate an object of it. :-)  \nAll that beautiful code full of parenthesis in the server file is an anonymous arrow IIFE! Woot indeed.  \n\nStart 'er up! bring up the terminal in IntelliJ and type: **npm start**  You will see the following output:  \n![Screenshot](/stuff/capture2.png)  \nPoint Chrome at the following address:  **127.0.0.1:8000** and BAM - you should see:  Look at my website!  \n\nWhew....  \n  \nStop. I bet you only skimmed some of the above material. GO BACK AND DEEPLY READ the stuff you skimmed. I used to be the same way. I get it. But, really, go back and absorb everything.  \n\n>Exercise time:  Change the output from your web server to give out formatted html around your output string. Surround your string with h1 tags and ensure it works in the browser.  \n\nIf you prefer a non-class-based web server, see [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc) video.  \n\n##### [In the next installment](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/17/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2/)\n\nWe'll add routes to our code and handle various mime types. In the 3rd & final installment, we'll add support for database handling, file I/O, and Ajax responding.  \n\np.s.

Also, you probably need a 'pew pew' break about now, so please go get some frag time logged and come back when you have all the wiggles out.  \n  \n#### Starting our 1st project\nPlease create a new, blank project in IntelliJ. It should look like this:  \n![Screenshot 1](/stuff/capture1.png)  \nNow we want to enter the following command to generate our **package.json** project file: **npm init** and answer all of the questions. BOOM! you are well on you way! Wait, what the heck is this file for anyway? Glad you asked, [THIS](http://browsenpm.org/package.json) interactive guide will walk you through all of the parts.  \n\nNext create a new JavaScript file in the root directory of your project and name it **app.js**. Inside the file, create a single-line comment on the top thusly:  **//todo:**  \nSince I like the new ES6 classes/objects structure, I'm gonna make you do it too. Create your class structure with the constructor and include the \"use strict\"; pragma and the module export on the bottom of your file. It should look like this:  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nFrom here, we have a decision to make. We can code our web server logic from scratch (LOTS of coding for something that already exists for free), or we can use the FREE library called **http**. Hmmmm, I think we'll use the already completed code in the library! Wanna know why? View the source code [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/lib)(start at http and follow the trail....).  \nSo, to add the library import for **http**, make your code look like this:  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n\tconstructor() {\n\n\t}\n\t\n\tloadServer() {\n\t    const HTTP = require('http');\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nNotice that I created an instance method called loadServer and declared/initialized a constant inside of it that is assigned to our library call. Since **http** is part of the standard Node.js library, I don't have to include it as a dependency in my **package.json** file. **_DO YOU UNDERSTAND??_** If not, take a minute, a figure out what you don't understand. Use the Googles, or StackOverflow....  \n  \nOk, we're getting there. Let's add some actual functionality. If we look at the **[http api](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)**, we can see the various methods we need to employ to get this dang thing to do stuff. The most important thing we want it to do is respond to web browser requests (well, actually, I'd also prefer it to not error-out when I try to start it up!). Add the following code which tells the server which port to listen for browser requests on & runs the **[createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener)** method of **http**.  \n\n```javascript\n//  todo:\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nclass app {\n     constructor() {\n          this.loadServer();\n     }\n\n     loadServer() {\n          const HTTP = require('http');\n          const PORT = 8000;\n\n          HTTP.createServer((request, response) => {\n               response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n               response.write(`Look at my website!`);\n               response.end();\n          }).listen(PORT);\n     }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```  \nWhoa, whoa, whoa..... What's all that response shenanigans? Well...., if you remember back to the earlier articles I asked you to read a few paragraphs up, you know that is how your little server responds back to the client web browser. **[response.writeHead](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers)** writes the header stuff, **[response.write](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_write_chunk_encoding_callback)** sends chunks of data back to the client browser. (In this case, just a simple string). **[response.end](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding_callback)** 'hangs up the phone.'\nCool, cool. But what does that **.listen(PORT)** thingy do? It is the [method](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback) that **http** actually uses to listen for incoming requests from your buddies trying to check out your new web coding skills!  \n\nTime to test this baby out. Since it is a class file, we need a way to instantiate an object from it. This is a three (3) step process:  \n1. Edit your **package.json** created earlier to change the scripts section from:  \n```javascript\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n```  \nto:  \n```javascript\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node bin/server\"\n  },\n```  \n\n2. Create a directory called **bin** in the root of our project.\n\n3. Create a file called **server** in the bin directory that has the following IIFE:  \n```javascript\n(() => {\n    const APP = require('../app.js');\n    new APP();\n})();\n```  \nRemember that **module.exports = app;** part at the bottom of your **app.js** file? This is how the **server** file can import it like a library and allow us to instantiate an object of it. :-)  \nAll that beautiful code full of parenthesis in the server file is an anonymous arrow IIFE! Woot indeed.  \n\nStart 'er up! bring up the terminal in IntelliJ and type: **npm start**  You will see the following output:  \n![Screenshot](/stuff/capture2.png)  \nPoint Chrome at the following address:  **127.0.0.1:8000** and BAM - you should see:  Look at my website!  \n\nWhew....  \n  \nStop. I bet you only skimmed some of the above material. GO BACK AND DEEPLY READ the stuff you skimmed. I used to be the same way. I get it. But, really, go back and absorb everything.  \n\n>Exercise time:  Change the output from your web server to give out formatted html around your output string. Surround your string with h1 tags and ensure it works in the browser.  \n\nIf you prefer a non-class-based web server, see [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc) video.  \n\n##### [In the next installment](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/17/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2/)\n\nWe'll add routes to our code and handle various mime types. In the 3rd & final installment, we'll add support for database handling, file I/O, and Ajax responding.  \n\np.s.

Since <strong>http</strong> is part of the standard Node.js library, I don’t have to include it as a dependency in my <strong>package.json</strong> file. <strong><em>DO YOU UNDERSTAND??</em></strong> If not, take a minute, a figure out what you don’t understand. Use the Googles, or StackOverflow….  </p>\n<p>Ok, we’re getting there. Let’s add some actual functionality. If we look at the <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html\">http api</a></strong>, we can see the various methods we need to employ to get this dang thing to do stuff. The most important thing we want it to do is respond to web browser requests (well, actually, I’d also prefer it to not error-out when I try to start it up!). Add the following code which tells the server which port to listen for browser requests on &amp; runs the <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener\">createServer</a></strong> method of <strong>http</strong>.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"comment\">//  todo:</span>\n<span class=\"meta\">\n\"use strict\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">app</span> </span>{\n     <span class=\"keyword\">constructor</span>() {\n          <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.loadServer();\n     }\n\n     loadServer() {\n          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HTTP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'http'</span>);\n          <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> PORT = <span class=\"number\">8000</span>;\n\n          HTTP.createServer(<span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">request, response</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n               response.writeHead(<span class=\"number\">200</span>, {<span class=\"string\">'Content-Type'</span>: <span class=\"string\">'text/plain'</span>});\n               response.write(<span class=\"string\">`Look at my website!`</span>);\n               response.end();\n          }).listen(PORT);\n     }\n}\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa….. What’s all that response shenanigans? Well…., if you remember back to the earlier articles I asked you to read a few paragraphs up, you know that is how your little server responds back to the client web browser. <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers\">response.writeHead</a></strong> writes the header stuff, <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_write_chunk_encoding_callback\">response.write</a></strong> sends chunks of data back to the client browser. (In this case, just a simple string). <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding_callback\">response.end</a></strong> ‘hangs up the phone.’<br>Cool, cool. But what does that <strong>.listen(PORT)</strong> thingy do? It is the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback\">method</a> that <strong>http</strong> actually uses to listen for incoming requests from your buddies trying to check out your new web coding skills!  </p>\n<p>Time to test this baby out. Since it is a class file, we need a way to instantiate an object from it. This is a three (3) step process:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Edit your <strong>package.json</strong> created earlier to change the scripts section from:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"string\">\"scripts\"</span>: {\n <span class=\"string\">\"test\"</span>: <span class=\"string\">\"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"</span>\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>to:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"string\">\"scripts\"</span>: {\n <span class=\"string\">\"start\"</span>: <span class=\"string\">\"node bin/server\"</span>\n},\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create a directory called <strong>bin</strong> in the root of our project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create a file called <strong>server</strong> in the bin directory that has the following IIFE:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"params\">()</span> =&gt;</span> {\n <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> APP = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'../app.js'</span>);\n <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> APP();\n})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remember that <strong>module.exports = app;</strong> part at the bottom of your <strong>app.js</strong> file? This is how the <strong>server</strong> file can import it like a library and allow us to instantiate an object of it. :-)<br>All that beautiful code full of parenthesis in the server file is an anonymous arrow IIFE! Woot indeed.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Start ‘er up! bring up the terminal in IntelliJ and type: <strong>npm start</strong>  You will see the following output:<br><img src=\"/stuff/capture2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"><br>Point Chrome at the following address:  <strong>127.0.0.1:8000</strong> and BAM - you should see:  Look at my website!  </p>\n<p>Whew….  </p>\n<p>Stop. I bet you only skimmed some of the above material. GO BACK AND DEEPLY READ the stuff you skimmed. I used to be the same way. I get it. But, really, go back and absorb everything.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exercise time:  Change the output from your web server to give out formatted html around your output string. Surround your string with h1 tags and ensure it works in the browser.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you prefer a non-class-based web server, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc\">THIS</a> video.  </p>\n<h5 id=\"In-the-next-installment\"><a href=\"#In-the-next-installment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"In the next installment\"></a><a href=\"https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/17/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2/\">In the next installment</a></h5><p>We’ll add routes to our code and handle various mime types.
