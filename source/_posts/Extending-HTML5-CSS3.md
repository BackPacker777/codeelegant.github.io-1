Now that you are an expert with HTML5 tags, CSS3 selectors, and project organization, let's look at extending our toolbox with some helpful tools & add-ons.

* First up are web fonts & icons. [HERE](https://frontendmasters.gitbooks.io/front-end-handbook-2017/content/learning/fonts.html) is the starting point for learning. [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a good resource too. You use these to add flair to your web app.
* Next is [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/guide). Sass extends CSS to make it more logical, easier to read, & easier to use. Sadly, browsers can't understand the Sass lingo, so you'll have to transpile it into CSS3. The tool I recommend is [Koala](http://koala-app.com/). Learning the basics of Sass can be found [HERE](http://callmenick.com/post/an-introduction-to-sass-scss) & [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCbXTrsl7NU&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBxQO2r_kmxn-0UqL_Rkj0t&index=1).
* Now, we'll look at CSS frameworks. Writing CSS is tedious and frustrating. Positioning, sizing, and centering things makes me want to drink. A lot. A framework is a library of recipes that have been cooked for you. All you have to do is put a reference to the library in the ```<head>``` portion of your HTML and viola! You access the framework functionality by adding ```class="something"``` to any of your HTML elements and it will be styled by the framework. Each framework has a reference page to explain each class keyword you can utilize. Good frameworks will be mobile first & ultra-responsive. The good list: [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Pure](https://purecss.io/), & [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).
* Speaking of responsive, [HERE](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/modern-field-guide-responsive-web-design) is a good article to teach you about this method of mobile 1st, auto-sizing development technique. [HERE](https://www.udemy.com/build-responsive-website-designs-with-html5-and-css/) is a free course. For fluid fonts, see [THIS](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/). [HERE](http://learnlayout.com/) is a nice layout tutorial. Please remember to add this to the ```<head>``` portion of your page:  ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">``` to ensure responsiveness.
* UX - User eXperience. Learn how to have an eye for design as you develop your web apps. [THIS](https://medium.com/@limedaring/design-for-non-designers-part-1-6559ed93ff91#.h2q6wlert) is a great article.

Lot's to read & do on that list, I'd say about **40** hours. Good luck & happy coding!
