I believe that students who choose programming as a vocation would be better served by learning _how_ to code first before they get into _what_ to code. The programming ecosystem is quite large and somewhat diverse, especially in the realm of editors/IDEs. Below, I will outline what seems to work best for me & my students and I will provide pertinent, curated learning materials that will hopefully help you get started and be productive. If you have had better luck along the way with different tools, please feel free to share! Please also be aware that I code in Windows 10, so you will have to modify your downloads for your OS. Please, please don't just glance at the educational material provided below. Really take the time to learn each tool. I am speaking from the school of hard knocks here as I wasn't always diligent and I paid the price in frustration later as I would go back and find the answer in the material. \n\n### Tools\n\n* IDE: [IntelliJ IDEa Ultimate](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) - There are a LOT of editors/IDEs out there (Sublime, Atom, etc.) and the Ultimate edition of IntelliJ is not cheap, but I feel like it is a work of art. With wonderful plugins, support for a lot of bleeding-edge web tech, and a large support pool on the interwebs it is my go-to IDE for all of my programming. Heck, they now even support Perl with a plugin! Learn [HERE](http://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2015/06/new-courseware-for-intellij-idea/).\n* Editor: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.3.html) - When I need to quick-open/edit a file, this is the tool I turn to. It has plenty of themes & plugins to make you happy and they are now [CIA proof](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html).\n* [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win) - This tool is needed to keep track of the changes you make to your programming files. Learn [HERE](http://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).\n*[GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com) - Additional utility you can use to publish the repositories you create with Git to the web.\n*[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - This is the engine that web browsers use to compile the JavaScript code that you write for webpages. They ripped it out, souped it up, and provied it for computers to utilize _outside the browser!_\n* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html?standalone=1) - Indespensible web browser because of its support of language features but _**ESPECIALLY**_ because of its [developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)!\n* IntelliJ plugins - At a minimum I recommend these: .ignore, CSS support, EJS, ESLint, Floobits, Git, Github, JavaScript, & NodeJS. I also like the Material Theme.\n* Global NPM modules - Use NPM to install these globally: npm install -g PM2, ESLint\n* Chrome Application: [Web server for Chrome](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) - Really handy for viewing your static web files locally.\n* SCSS transpiler [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) - VERY easy SCSS to CSS transpiler (converts SCSS to CSS). I will cover this in a later post.\n\n### Sites\n\n* The PREMIER static learning resource on the whole of the internet (IMHO) is the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web). This should be your default reference.\n* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) - THE sitefor getting questions answered, but beware: Be sure you've exhausted all of your other resources 1st before asking a question here lest you find yourself kicked into a donkey rape-pit of disdain from the elite users of the site.\n* [HashNode](https://hashnode.com/) - A more gentle, but less effective question answering site.\n* Reddit - [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/), [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/), [r/learnjavascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/) are all indispensable resources!\n\n\n#### Final Thought\n\nIt is assumed before you ever dig into any type of programming that you know how to computer. What I mean by that is that you know how to manage your files & folders on your computer. If you do not, here are two resources for Windows users: [RESOURCE 1](http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2163343), [RESOURCE 2](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-files-folders-file-explorer/).\n\nThat should be WAY more than enough stuff to explore and install to get you up and running so you can start coding!","source":"_posts/Start-the-Beginning.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Start @ the Beginning\ndate: 2017-03-14 06:58:34\ntags:\n---\n\nI lament the fact that the college I teach programming at does not offer a _'tooling'_ class.
