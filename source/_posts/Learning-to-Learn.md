Before we jump into the actual meat & potatoes, I want to present a major aside on how to learn. [Head First Labs](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) has a really interesting approach to how the brain retains material over at their [Theory/Formula page](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/readme.php).

Additionally, Coursera has a whole **[course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)** dedicated to this topic that was nicely summed up in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GetMotivated). [Here](http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/learning-how-to-learn) is a TEDx Talk by the main instructor from the course. [Here](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4#.tv8jlucxw) is a nice summary from someone in the tech industry who took the course.

Finallly, [this](https://hbr.org/2016/03/learning-to-learn) article from _Harvard Business Review_ gives additional insight.

##### Exercise
> Take the free version (or pay the $50 if you want a certificate for your résumé) of the Coursera course above and submit a screenshot of your completion status when your done. I also need you to take **HAND WRITTEN** notes for the entire course (you'll see why in the course!), scan them, and submit with your screenshot. All submissions will be to your GitHub page, and the link provided to me. THIS WILL TAKE A MINIMUM of 9 hours so plan accordingly. This is a pre-requisite to continue in my courses. 

After you've investigated the above, we'll jump right into our course material!
