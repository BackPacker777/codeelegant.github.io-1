After completing [lesson 1](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/16/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver/), & [lesson 2](https://codeelegant.github.io/2017/03/17/Vanilla-Node-js-Webserver-2/), you have a web server that can serve static web pages on par with the very _excellent_ [http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). WHAT!?!? You could have just used a library and had a canned web server without having to write all that code? Yes, it's true. That's not really why you're here though, is it? You are here to learn how to write code & to understand JavaScript & Node.js better.  

In this, the last lesson in the 'Vanilla Node.js web server' series, we are going to tackle some more dynamic functionality: Databases with [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb), csv files, and html templating with [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/).
